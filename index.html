        <p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea
            species. From the coffee fruit, the seeds are separated to produce a stable, raw product: unroasted green
            coffee. The seeds are then roasted, a process which transforms them into a consumable product: roasted
            coffee, which is ground into fine particles that are typically steeped in hot water before being filtered
            out, producing a cup of coffee.

            Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to
            its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world and can be prepared <br> and
            presented in a variety of ways </p></div>>
